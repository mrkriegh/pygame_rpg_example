# pygame_rpg_example
Second project to learn python through game development.

# Back Story
This project will be a slower paced development of a mish-mash of the previous project and another tutorial done by @ClearCode (https://youtube.com/@ClearCode/videos). This time, I will be utilizing his Pydew Valley tutorial to create a game that has more interactions within the game world, and start to build in the kind of mechanics to allow the player to interact with a story. As with the last project, this will be entirely for educational purposes. While I will be getting closer to a full rpg type game here, the point is to learn how to use python and various programming concepts. This means that not all choices will be the most efficient, if I can justify to myself using a new structure or algorithm. The schedule for this project will be a little more relaxed than the last, so I will have longer periods of time in between commits and updates.

# Planned Features
As with my last project, I will be planning out my work using GitHub's Projects, but I will be taking a much more laid back pace. I expect to be able to push new commits about once a month. With this in mind, I am going to try to hit the following features to consider this project complete:
* Player Inventory
* Entity Inventory, player can: take / buy / trade / sell / place
* Dialog System. Allow player to open dialog with friendly npcs, open trade, learn about quests, accept / complete / abandon quests
* Quest System. This will come in two forms: mini-quest, main-quest
  * Mini-Quest. This will use at least three base quest formats with random inputs to give the player a wide variety of similar quests to complete or grind through
  * Main Quest. This will be a series of scripted quest objectives and outcomes. At least one main quest with four sub-quests must be created to count this as complete
* Map Interaction. Allow the player to interact with different objects on the map. This will include: picking up / placing items, interacting with static objects with their own controls, using items on the environment
